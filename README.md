# Using Let In JavaScript
Hey JavaScript devs! Time to learn a way of declaring variables in JavaScript!
In JavaScript you can use let to declare a variable that has a value that **will**
change or update.

Some other cool things about let are:
 ◦ You can define a variable with this but not immediately assign it a value by just saying let and the variable name. 
       ▪ Later you can assign the variable a value
       ▪ Can be reassigned
       ▪ You cannot redeclare a variable within the same block of code
       
**You use let to declare a variable and assign it like:**

let applePies = 3; // note the ; is optional but it helps keep your code more readable so it's up to you if you want to use it!

**You can use let to declare a variable while not assigning a value to it like:**

let applePies;

**Later you can assign a value like:**

applePies = 5;

**You can also update variables:**

let applePies = 2;
applePies += 1;  // (answer would be 3)


**Some common ways to update the variable with let are by using:**

+=
-=
